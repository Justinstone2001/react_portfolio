        <p className='aboutTxt'> Welcome to my portfolio! I am a current senior at Davidson college studying computer science and Hispanic studies. 
            I have worked in computer science for 2 years of college courses and am now learning full stack web development 
            through the UNCC bootcamp. I plan to go to graduate school to study cybersecurity and continue my computer science education.
